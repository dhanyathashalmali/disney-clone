# Disney Clone Project

This project is a clone of the Disney website interface. It has been created as part of my learning journey on [codedamn](https://codedamn.com). It showcases various features and technologies I've learned, including React components, state management, responsive design, and more.

## Features

- **React Components**: Reusable components for efficient code management.
- **State Management**: Proper state handling for dynamic content updates.
- **Responsive Design**: A mobile-friendly interface that adapts to various screen sizes.
- **Interactive Slider Bar**: A slider bar in the navigation for an enhanced user experience.
- **Styling with CSS**: Custom CSS for visually appealing design elements.

## Technologies Used

- React.js
- CSS3
- JavaScript ES6+

## Project Setup

To get this project up and running on your local machine, follow these steps:

1.  **Clone the repository:** https://github.com/dhanyathashalmali/disney-clone/
2. **Navigate into the project directory:** cd disney-clone  
3. **Install dependencies:** npm install
4. **Start the development server:** npm run dev
   
### Troubleshooting

If you encounter an error like `'vite' is not recognized as an internal or external command`, follow these steps:

1. Ensure Vite is installed: npm install vite --save-dev
2. Verify your `package.json`:

 It should include:
 ```json
 "scripts": {
   "dev": "vite --host --port 1337"
 }
 ```

3. Try running the dev script again:
 ```
 npm run dev
 ```
